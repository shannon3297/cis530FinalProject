### by Shannon Lin, Hiyori Yoshida, Varun Ramakrishnan

This is the Github repository for our CIS 530 Final Project on COVID-19 vaccine perception. It contains all of the code we wrote over the course of the four milestones. Please visit the individual final submission folders for final code: data, code, output. These folders are also submitted on Gradescope and contain READMEs on how to run each file.
